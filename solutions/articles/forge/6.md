> practical explanation of ActionResultType use-cases:

SUCCESS   
Use this when your item/block/entity has met all the requirements for the interaction, and you have completed everything that needs to be done. This will prevent any further action from being taken with the interaction.

CONSUME   
You can use this when you meet the same conditions as SUCCESS, but additionally are consuming an item/block as part of the interaction. This ActionResultType isn't explicitly checked as of 1.15.2, and so using this is mostly optional.
This will prevent any further action from being taken with the interaction.

PASS   
Use this when you do not meet any of the requirements for the interaction (not holding the right item, etc.). This signals for the game to attempt to interact with the other hand, and also try to use the item's interaction methods and other similar methods.

FAIL  
Use this when you have met the minimum requirements for the interaction (holding the right block, etc.), but fail to meet further criteria. This should be used when you want to indicate that the player intended to interact with your object, but failed to meet further criteria.
This will prevent any further action from being taken with the interaction.
