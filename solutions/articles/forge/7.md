> an item that uses durability when you craft something with that.

You just need a class for your item and in that class you have to override the following methods, which damage the item when it is used in an crafting recipe:
```java
@Override
public boolean hasContainerItem(ItemStack stack) {
    return true;
}

public boolean doesContainerItemLeaveCraftingGrid(ItemStack stack) {
    return false;
}

@Override
public ItemStack getContainerItem(ItemStack itemstack) {
    ItemStack stack = itemstack.copy();
    if (stack.getMaxDamage() - stack.getDamage() <= 1) {
        stack.shrink(1);
    } else {
     stack.attemptDamageItem(1, random, null);
    }
        return stack;
}
```

It is also important to set the `maxStackSize` to 1 and the `maxDamage` to your durability/damage value in the item properties, when you register the item.
