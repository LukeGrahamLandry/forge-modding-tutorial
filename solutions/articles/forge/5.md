> When you open your container with a block in hand, the block places for a split second

you need to make sure that it returns `ActionResultType.SUCCESS` instead of `ActionResultType.FAIL`.  
  
This is because the client will try to use your held item instead and get confused. Likewise if you place a block on the client, but not on the server, it'll render the block being placed anyway.
