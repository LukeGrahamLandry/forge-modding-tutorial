> how to properly get keyboard input

first you'll need to register your keybind to do that
```java
public static registerKeyBinds(){
    public static final KeyBinding myKeybind = new KeyBinding("key.my_keybind", GLFW.GLFW_KEY_P,       "key.categories.misc");
    ClientRegistry.registerKeyBinding(myKeyBind);
}
```
and then call this method in your fmlclient setup
then to actually do what you want to do make a `InputEvent.KeyInputEvent` event
that's it if you want your keybind to do client stuff

The below can also be used for packets
However if you want your keybind to some thing on server side like shoot an entity or server side things
you'll need to send packet's from client to server .....

forge docs have pretty good docs for it(like the only thing)
```java
public class Networking {
    private static SimpleChannel INSTANCE;
    private static int ID = 0;
    private static int nextID() {
        return ID++;
    }
    public static void registerMessages() {
        INSTANCE = NetworkRegistry.newSimpleChannel(new ResourceLocation(MOD_ID + "networking"),
                () -> "1.0", s -> true, s -> true);    
        INSTANCE.messageBuilder(MyPacketClass.class, nextID())
        .encoder(MyPacketClass::toBytes)
        .decoder(MyPacketClass::new)
        .consumer(MyPacketClass::handle)
        .add();
    }

    public static void sendToServer(Object packet) {
        INSTANCE.sendToServer(packet);
    }
    public static void sendToClient(Object packet, ServerPlayerEntity player) {
        INSTANCE.sendTo(packet, player.connection.netManager, NetworkDirection.PLAY_TO_CLIENT);
    }
```
make this class and remember to call registerMessages function in common setupto make your packet class 
```java
public class ChangeSpellPacket {
    private final int id;
    public ChangeSpellPacket(PacketBuffer buf) {
        id = buf.readInt();
    }
    public ChangeSpellPacket(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public void toBytes(PacketBuffer buf) {
        buf.writeInt(id);    
    }

    public boolean handle(Supplier<NetworkEvent.Context> ctx) {
        ctx.get().enqueueWork(() -> {
            doShit()
        });
        return true;
    }
}
```
just do this simples and what you want to do should be in handle method and inside the event send the packet to server
```java
if (KeyBindInit.myKeyBind.isPressed()) {
    Networking.sendToServer(new MyPacketClass(1));
}
```
