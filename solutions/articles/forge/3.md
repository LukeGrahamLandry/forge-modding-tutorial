> Blocks with transparency

When wanting to add a block which has transparency/invisible pixels you must add this line to your ``FMLClientSetupEvent``
```java
RenderTypeLookup.setRenderLayer(YourBlocksListClass.YourBlock.get(), RenderType.getCutout());
```

There are also other RenderTypes which can be used other than `getCutout()`  
e.g use translucent if your texture has partially transparent pixels  
  
Note: your block cannot extend ContainerBlock!
