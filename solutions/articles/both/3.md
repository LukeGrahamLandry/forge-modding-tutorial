> help why item in game called item.bruhmod.bruh

1. make sure the lang is in correct place (`assets/$modid/lang/`)
2. lang correct file name `$language_name.json`, language_name is usually `en_us`
3. lang valid json, pass it through random json lint you can find on the internet
4. check you translated the correct thing, the thing that the game shows in game is what you should have translated in the lang
